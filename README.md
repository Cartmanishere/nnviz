## NNViz :

This is a simple library I built for my Artificical Neural Networks course.

It provides functions using which you can easily visualize the decision boundary learned by any classifier (Nerual Network or others).

Check the `output_demo.ipynb` for examples.

There is also support so you can directly visualize the decision boundary of any keras model as well.

This is a WIP/Unfinished project. Use it for reference in case you have the requirement for same kind of functionality.

Feel free to extend it however you want.
